Observations
Observation 1: The players in age range 35-39 only account for ~5% of players, they purchase more expensive optional items and spend more on average during each purchase. The company may want to expand their reach to more of this user base to increase revenue.

Observation 2: The most popular and profitable items are above the 4USD mark, which is towards the higher range of offerings (versus the 1 USD - 2 USD options). This may mean the user base may not be as cost conscious and there might be an opportunity to increase revenue. aming company should look into these top items and identify the key attributes and provide simlar offerings

Observation 3: Female & Other genders accound for a very low percentage of the user base. There may be an opportunity to dig deeper to determine whether this is representative of the gaming industry as a whole and see if there is an opportunity to market to other genders without losing the key attributes that cater to the core male user-base
